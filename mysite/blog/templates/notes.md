The preceding structure will be the file structure for your templates. The base.html file will include 
the  main  HTML  structure  of  the  website  and  divide  the  content  into  the  main  content  area  and  a  
sidebar. The list.html and detail.html files will inherit from the base.html file to render the blog 
post list and detail views, respectively.
Django has a powerful template language that allows you to specify how data is displayed. It is based 
on template tags, template variables, and template filters:
• Template tags control the rendering of the template and look like {% tag %}
• Template variables get replaced with values when the template is rendered and look like {{ 
variable }}
• Template filters allow you to modify variables for display and look like {{ variable|filter }}
You can see all built-in template tags and filters at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/
templates/builtins/.



* Always use the {% url %} template tag to build URLs in your templates instead of writing 
hardcoded URLs. This will make your URLs more maintainable.
